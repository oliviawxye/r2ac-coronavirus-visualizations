# Coronavirus Visualizations for Race to a Cure

Visualizations were created by Olivia Ye and Emma Huang based on datasets gathered by the science team. Visualizations were implemented on the website by the Race to a Cure operations team. View them here - https://www.racetoacure.org/covid-19-visualizations.

Visualizations were created using JavaScript, HTML, CSS, and D3.js.

Special thanks to Curran Kelleher and Yan Holtz for the online D3.js resources we consulted while learning and using D3.js.
